## Project Overview

IFC Viewer is a lightweight, web-based 3D viewer for BIM (Building Information Modeling) models in IFC format. It provides an accessible way to view and interact with building models directly in the browser, without requiring specialized software installation.

### Key Features

- **Fast Loading**: Optimized loading and rendering of large IFC files
- **Interactive 3D View**: Smooth navigation and model interaction
- **Section Views**: Dynamic sectioning tools for model exploration
- **Measurement Tools**: Distance, area, and angle measurements
- **Property Information**: Access to BIM object properties and metadata
- **Mobile Responsive**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
- **Export Options**: Screenshots and basic measurements export

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture

The viewer is built on modern web technologies with a focus on performance and usability:

```javascript
class IFCViewer {
  constructor() {
    this.scene = new THREE.Scene();
    this.renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer();
    this.ifcLoader = new IFCLoader();
    this.measurementTools = new MeasurementTools();
    this.propertyManager = new PropertyManager();
  }

  async loadModel(url) {
    const model = await this.ifcLoader.loadAsync(url);
    this.scene.add(model);
    this.setupPropertyTree(model);
  }
}
```

### Key Technologies

**Frontend:**
- **Three.js**: 3D visualization engine
- **web-ifc**: IFC parsing and processing
- **WebGL**: Hardware-accelerated rendering
- **Web Workers**: Background processing for large models

**Features:**
- Real-time section cutting
- Measurement tools
- Property tree navigation
- Model tree exploration
- Custom shader materials

## Development Process

### Challenges Overcome

1. **Performance Optimization**
   - Implemented level-of-detail systems
   - Optimized geometry processing
   - Added progressive loading

2. **Cross-browser Compatibility**
   - WebGL feature detection
   - Fallback rendering modes
   - Mobile touch controls

3. **Large Model Handling**
   - Streaming load system
   - Octree-based culling
   - Memory management

- IFC writing capabilities

### Community Feedback

Current user requests include:
- BCF support
- Multiple model comparison
- Custom property definitions
- Advanced filtering

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/tadodev/ifc-viewer

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Model Loading

```javascript
const viewer = new IFCViewer('container');
await viewer.loadModel('path/to/model.ifc');
viewer.fitToView();
```

### Measurement Mode

```javascript
viewer.enableMeasurements();
const distance = await viewer.measureDistance();
console.log(`Measured distance: ${distance}m`);
```

## Lessons Learned

1. **Performance First**: Building for performance from the start is crucial
2. **User Testing**: Early user feedback shaped the interface design
3. **Progressive Enhancement**: Starting with core features and adding complexity
4. **Mobile Considerations**: Designing for touch interfaces from the beginning
