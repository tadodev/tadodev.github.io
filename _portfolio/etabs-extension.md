## Project Overview

The ETABS Extension Suite is a collection of productivity tools and automation plugins designed for structural engineers working with ETABS (Extended Three-Dimensional Analysis of Building Systems). This project bridges my structural engineering expertise with software development skills to create tools that solve real-world engineering challenges.

### Core Objectives

- **Automate Repetitive Tasks**: Eliminate manual, time-consuming operations
- **Enhance Accuracy**: Reduce human error in design calculations  
- **Standardize Workflows**: Implement consistent design procedures
- **Generate Reports**: Automated documentation and calculation sheets
- **Integrate with CAD**: Seamless workflow between ETABS and AutoCAD

## Key Features

### 1. Automated Design Tools

**Beam Design Automation**
- Automatic beam sizing based on load combinations
- Code compliance checking (ACI 318, TCVN 5574, Eurocode 2)
- Reinforcement detailing and scheduling
- Deflection and crack width verification

**Column Design Assistant**  
- Interaction diagram generation
- Biaxial bending analysis
- Slenderness effect calculations
- Automated reinforcement arrangement

### 2. Model Generation Tools

**Grid System Generator**
- Parametric grid creation with custom spacing
- Automatic story definition
- Mass assignment for seismic analysis
- Load pattern setup

**Foundation Designer**
- Isolated footing design and detailing
- Mat foundation analysis
- Bearing capacity verification
- Settlement calculations

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture Overview

The extension suite follows a modular architecture built on the ETABS API:

```csharp
// Core extension structure
public class ETABSExtensionCore
{
    private cOAPI ETABSObject;
    private cSapModel SapModel;
    
    public ETABSExtensionCore()
    {
        InitializeETABSConnection();
        LoadModules();
    }
    
    private void InitializeETABSConnection()
    {
        ETABSObject = new SAP2000v1.SapObjectClass();
        SapModel = ETABSObject.SapModel;
    }
}
```

### Key Technologies

**Primary Development Stack:**
- **C# .NET Framework 4.8**: Core development language
- **ETABS API**: COM-based interface for ETABS integration  
- **Windows Forms**: User interface development
- **Microsoft Office Interop**: Excel/Word report generation
- **AutoCAD .NET API**: CAD drawing integration

## Documentation & Reporting

**Calculation Sheets**
- Automated design calculation generation
- Code reference integration
- Professional formatting with company branding
- PDF export capabilities

**Drawing Generation**
- Reinforcement detail drawings
- Section schedules and tables
- Plan view annotations
- AutoCAD integration for final drawings
