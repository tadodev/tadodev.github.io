## Hello, I'm Thanh Tu Do üëã

I'm a structural engineer who discovered a passion for software development and decided to bridge these two worlds. My journey from designing bridges and buildings to writing code has been an exciting adventure that combines analytical thinking with creative problem-solving.

## My Background

### Engineering Foundation üèóÔ∏è

With a background in structural engineering, I've spent years:
- Designing and analyzing complex structural systems
- Ensuring safety and reliability in construction projects
- Working with building codes, regulations, and industry standards
- Collaborating with multidisciplinary teams on large-scale projects
- Developing a keen eye for detail and systematic problem-solving

### Transition to Software Development üíª

My interest in technology grew as I began using software tools for engineering calculations and project management. This curiosity led me to:
- Learn programming languages like Python, JavaScript, and more
- Build automation tools to streamline engineering workflows
- Contribute to open-source projects
- Develop web applications and data analysis tools
- Explore modern development frameworks and best practices

## What I Do Now

### Current Focus üéØ

I'm currently focused on:
- **Full-stack web development** using modern frameworks
- **Data analysis and visualization** for engineering applications
- **Automation tools** that bridge engineering and software domains
- **Open source contributions** to projects I'm passionate about
- **Technical writing** about engineering and software development

### Skills & Technologies üõ†Ô∏è

**Programming Languages:**
- Python (Django, Flask, Data Analysis)
- JavaScript (React, Node.js, Vue.js)
- HTML/CSS (Responsive Design, SASS)
- SQL (PostgreSQL, MySQL)

**Tools & Technologies:**
- Git/GitHub for version control
- Docker for containerization
- Cloud platforms (AWS, Digital Ocean)
- Engineering software (AutoCAD, SAP2000, ETABS)
- Data visualization (D3.js, Chart.js, Matplotlib)

**Engineering Expertise:**
- Structural analysis and design
- Building codes and standards
- Project management
- Technical documentation
- Quality assurance and testing

## My Philosophy

I believe that the principles that make great engineering also make great software:

- **Safety First**: Just as structures must be safe and reliable, code should be robust and well-tested
- **Efficiency Matters**: Both in structural design and software architecture, efficiency is key
- **Attention to Detail**: Small details can make the difference between success and failure
- **Continuous Learning**: Both fields evolve rapidly, requiring constant skill development
- **Collaboration**: Great projects are built by great teams working together

## Beyond Work

When I'm not coding or calculating structural loads, you can find me:
- üìö Reading about new technologies and engineering innovations
- üå± Contributing to open-source projects
- ‚úçÔ∏è Writing technical articles and tutorials
- üéØ Exploring the intersection of engineering and technology
- üåç Connecting with other professionals making career transitions

## Let's Connect

I'm always interested in connecting with fellow engineers, developers, and anyone passionate about technology. Whether you're looking to collaborate on a project, discuss career transitions, or just chat about the latest tech trends, feel free to reach out!
